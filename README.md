`imageDigitizer` is an R shiny app that can be used to digitize points on a
graph that is contained in a PNG image. Here's how to get started:

1. Copy a `.png` file here. It should contain a graph that uses linear axes.

2. Type `"library(imageDigitize);imageDigitize()` in an R console.

3. Follow the directions you see in the control panels.
