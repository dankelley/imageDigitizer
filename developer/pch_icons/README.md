This directory is for developers only, not for users.

Files contained herein are used to rebuild the icons for plot symbols.  The
procedure ought to be clear to those who understand unix Make files, but should
only be followed by those who also understand R reasonably well, and have
inspected the relevant code in some depth, because the way the app works goes
beyond the normal R-shiny methodologies, so that icons can be used for labels
in the `Plot Symbols` GUI element.
